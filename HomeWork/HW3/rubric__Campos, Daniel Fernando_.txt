1/1	type word
2/2	HEAD adj
2/2	NUM pl
2/2	GEND masc
1/1	SPR <>
1/1	COMPS <> 
1/1	MOD is HEAD noun

1/1	RELN small (or pequeno or pequenos)
2/2	MOD.INDEX = small.ARG
	


16/16	Part B: 16
	
2/2	" tree geometry is consistent with MOD value (high attachment of adjective if they said MOD < NP >, low if they said MOD < NOM >)."
1/1	"non-empty SPR values (1 or 2, depending on tree geometry)"
1/1	non-empty SPR values identified with D node
1/1	no extraneous non-empty SPR values
1/1	no extraneous non-empty COMPS value
1/1	non-empty MOD value (on A)
2/2	"non-empty MOD value identified with NOM (or NP, as appropriate)"
1/1	no extraneous non-empty MOD values
4/4	"INDEX shared on all four nodes other than A. (If also shared on A, that's ok)"
1/1	penguin.INST = small.ARG
1/1	effect of semantic compositionality principle (either via tags or via repeating the predications on higher nodes)
	


8/8	Part C: 8
	
4/4	Lex entry for pequenos identifies small.ARG with MOD's INDEX
4/4	Effect of HMR
	


23/25	"Chapter 6, Problem 3"
	


8/10	Part A: 10
 	 	 COMMENT: not necessarily noun
"(some reasonable statement of the generalization, beyond just saying ""it is after an NP"". Ideally: possessor and possessum mentioned, as well as the right edge of th possessor NP.)"
