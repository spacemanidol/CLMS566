 	 	 COMMENT: The logic is unclear (and does not lead to the right answer)
	
51/55	8.6


5/5	Part A:
1/1	HSR - same as English (in prose or in feature structures):
2/2	HCR - complements before head (order of comps doesn't matter):
2/2	nothing else wrong
	


28/30	Part B:
	For each lexical entry:
3/3	"Reasonable stem form (e.g., yonda or yom- or yon-) 1 each"
1/3	Type of feature structure (lexeme or appropriate type that they defined) 1 each
3/3	HEAD verb 1 each
3/3	SPR non-empty 1 each
3/3	Appropriate RELN value (Japanese word or English translation) 1 each
3/3	INDEX = SIT 1 each
	
12/12	ARG-ST (or SPR + COMPS): 
6/6	Arguments linked to correct roles 1 each role
6/6	CASE values
	


12/14	Part C:
2/2	Forms 1 each = 2
0/2	Type of feature structure (lexeme or appropriate type that they defined) 1 each
2/2	HEAD noun 1 each
2/2	Optional SPR on hon
2/2	DP doesn't end up on COMPS on hon
2/2	no CASE specified 1 each
2/2	appropriate RELN values  1 each
2/2	appropriate INDEX values 1 each
	


6/6	Part D
1/1	Type is i-rule
1/1	OUTPUT form is some function of INPUT form
2/2	OUTPUT (or INPUT) says [CASE acc]
1/1	INPUT is constrained to be a noun (through defined lexeme type or HEAD value)
1/1	no constraints that would give unification failure in rule or give rise to bad word structures
	
	


20/30	Chapter 8.7:


1/1	Part A: NOM 
	


1/1	Part B: DAT


11/11	Part C:
	
1/1	Type  word
1/1	HEAD verb
1/1	ARG-ST has 3 elements
3/3	CASE values aligned with semantic roles
3/3	Each NP's index is matched to a semantic role
2/2	SEM value copied over correctly
	


7/17	Part D:
	
1/1	d-rule
2/1	INPUT restricted to verbs
1/2	RESTR on OUTPUT = INPUT's RESTR + cause RLEN
0/2	OUTPUT.INDEX = cause.SIT
0/1	INPUT.INDEX = cause.CAUSED-EVENT
1/1	output form is a function of input form
0/1	OUTPUT's first ARG-ST has [CASE nom]
0/2	OUTPUT's first ARG-ST.INDEX = cause.CAUSER
0/1	OUTPUT's second ARG-ST has [CASE dat]
0/2	OUTPUT's second ARG-ST.INDEX = INPUT.ARG-ST.FIRST.INDEX
0/1	Does not identify INPUT.ARG-ST.FIRST (whole feature structure) with OUTPUT.ARG-ST.REST.FIRST
1/1	Allows additional arguments (copied from INPUT to OUTPUT)
	Ñ- okay if this requires one additional argument (as in data given).
1/1	no other constraints that would give unification failure in rule or give rise to bad word structures
